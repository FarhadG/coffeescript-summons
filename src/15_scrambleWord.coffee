### SCRAMBLE WORD
  Write a function that takes two inputs: a word and an array of
  other words. Your program must return all of the words from the array
  that our input word can unscramble to.

  For example: scrambleWord("cat", ["tac", "toc"])) returns ["tac"]
###

scrambleWord = (str, arr) ->
  "summon"








# for Mocha testing
module.exports = scrambleWord
